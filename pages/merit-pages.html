    <h2>What is Merit Pages?</h2>

    <p>Weber State University wants to celebrate your successes with the people who care about you. Using Merit Pages, we can send personalized news stories to you, your friends, family, high school and hometown newspapers. Whether you participate in undergraduate research or service learning, win a competition or succeed academically, we want to be loud and proud about your accomplishments.</p>

    <h2>What Happens With Merit Pages Achievement Stories?</h2>

    <p>As a Weber State student, when you are included in a Merit story, you will receive a link to the story through your student email account. The story will also be shared with the email addresses of the family that you provided as part of the admissions process. Hometown newspapers and state legislators will also receive the news based on the zip code associated with your permanent address. High schools are alerted to your accomplishments based on the admission application information.</p>

    <p>Most of this information can be updated in your Merit profile. To view and make changes to which addresses are on file for your account, log in to <a class="fancy-link" href="https://meritpages.com/login">Merit</a> and go to &ldquo;My Account.&rdquo; From there, click on &ldquo;Privacy.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>How to Make Sure Family Members Receive Merit Stories</h2>

    <p>Family members whose email addresses are on record will automatically be alerted each time a new story is posted. You can also direct people to&nbsp;<a class="fancy-link" href="https://weber.meritpages.com/">weber.meritpages.com</a> to search for your name and then click the &ldquo;follow&rdquo; button. They will be prompted to create an account that allows them to follow your achievements. If you prefer not to share stories with family members associated with their registration information, you can remove those email addresses from automatic distribution by logging into your Merit account, clicking on &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; and then clicking &ldquo;Privacy.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2 dir="ltr">Weber State Respects Your Privacy&nbsp;</h2>

    <p dir="ltr">Your stories will remain private until you choose to opt into Merit. Because we value student privacy, student Merit pages are set to be private by default and are not searchable on or indexed by search engines such as Google, unless you click the &ldquo;make page searchable&rdquo; button.</p>

    <p>Once you&#39;ve signed in and opted in, stories containing&nbsp;your first and last name will be shared automatically with family, hometown news outlets, state representatives and high school principals and counselors. You&nbsp;can also use these stories to share on your social media accounts. To view and make changes to who receives Merit updates, you can click on &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; in your <a class="fancy-link" href="https://weber.meritpages.com/">Merit account.</a></p>

    <p>You can opt out the first time you log in,&nbsp;or&nbsp;click the &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; button at the bottom of the welcome email. If you decide to opt out later, you can click &ldquo;My Account,&rdquo; &ldquo;Privacy,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Opt Out,&rdquo; or email <a class="fancy-link" href="mailto:mediarelations@weber.edu">media relations.</a></p>
