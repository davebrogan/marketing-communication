<h2 dir="ltr">What We Do</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Whether you&rsquo;re a member of the media or work at Weber State and need help writing a press release, our media relations professionals can help. We can assist with promoting events and are the point of contact for members of the press.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Media Relations Guidelines</h2>

<p dir="ltr">A news release is written to promote newsworthy campus events and is distributed to targeted members of the media and to members of the community.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Successful media relations depend on promoting events far enough in advance so local media outlets have adequate time to promote and/or plan to cover Weber State University events and news.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Getting Started</h3>

<p dir="ltr">For events, please request a press release no later than two weeks prior to an event. When requesting a press release, please include answers to:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
    <li role="presentation">Who?</li>
    <li role="presentation">What?</li>
    <li role="presentation">When?</li>
    <li role="presentation">Where?</li>
    <li role="presentation">Why?</li>
    <li role="presentation">How much does it cost?</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">Include high-resolution photos of your speaker and/or a graphic element associated with the event.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most press releases written by Marketing &amp; Communications are posted on the weber.edu homepage and can include video or audio files embedded in the release, as well as links to other web pages and sources referenced in the release. If you have content like this, let us know so we can include it.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">FAQ&nbsp;</h2>

<h3 dir="ltr">Why won&rsquo;t you publicize our annual event?</h3>

<p dir="ltr">A lot of factors go into news outlets determining what to cover. Annual events are important, but by their very nature (they happen every year) they don&rsquo;t always lend themselves to being newsworthy. A new event or one that has a new angle is much more appealing to news organizations. Likewise, just because your event has attracted a lot of press coverage in the past, doesn&rsquo;t mean it will receive similar coverage this year.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Why don&rsquo;t you publicize performing arts or athletics events?</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Performing Arts and Wildcat Athletics have their own publicists who write press releases and work with the local media.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Why didn&rsquo;t I hear about that speaker who was on campus last week until after the fact?</h3>

<p dir="ltr">We do our best to learn about upcoming events and publicize them, but we don&rsquo;t always learn of events in time to promote them.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">How do I get my event/news on TV?</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Attracting television news coverage is extremely difficult. The physical distance between Ogden and Salt Lake City (where the four local affiliates are based) presents an obstacle to TV news coverage. Similarly, TV news is most interested in stories with great visuals. A successful pitch to TV means something with opportunities for action and strong pictures, and/or one that is exclusive to that television station.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Why isn&rsquo;t my event listed on the weber.edu home page?</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Space on the weber.edu homepage is limited and the number of events we are asked to publicize often exceeds the number of slots available on the main page. More information regarding Featured Events and homepage banner placement is available from our <a class="fancy-link" href="http://weber.edu/marcomm">web team.</a></p>
