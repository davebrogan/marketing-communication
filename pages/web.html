          <p>Marketing &amp; Communications can help with web pages within the weber.edu domain. This can include changing visual elements, adding or removing text or creating a new page (or series of pages) altogether. If you choose to go outside the weber.edu domain, you will lose our IT and web design support.<br />
            Once we&#39;ve completed a web project for you, the maintenance is your responsibility. Before you get started maintaining this site, there are a few steps you need to take to familiarize yourself with Site Manager and best practices for maintaining WSU&rsquo;s professional, cohesive online presence.

          <p>Having accessible web pages means having web content accessible to all users, including those with disabilities who may use assistive technology while browsing our website. This is a top priority for Weber State. Our <a class="fancy-link" href="https://www.weber.edu/WebGuide/AccessibilityGuide.html">accessibility standards for the web document</a> is required reading for every person who will be editing a page on your site. Along with being a good practice in general, web accessibility is required by law as part of The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act in the U.S., and a range of international regulations. Websites that do not meet these standards leave Weber State vulnerable to lawsuits.</p>

          <p><img alt="" class="best-practice-icon" src="https://apps.weber.edu/wsuimages/marketing-communications/icons/green-ok-check-solid.svg" />&nbsp;<strong>DO</strong>:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Perform regular maintenance. Make it a once-a-semester project to update faculty/staff pages, and make sure someone is regularly updating news/events pages.</li>
            <li>Have someone proofread when you are making changes to a page. Even the best of us make mistakes.</li>
            <li>Label links descriptively. Do not use &ldquo;click here,&rdquo; or &ldquo;visit this page.&rdquo; Link text should clearly identify what the user will find on the new page.
              <ul>
                <li>Example: For more information, see our <a class="fancy-link" href="http://weber.edu/">Homecoming Event Schedule</a>.</li>

          <p><img alt="" class="best-practice-icon" src="https://apps.weber.edu/wsuimages/marketing-communications/icons/red-dont-check-solid.svg" />&nbsp;<strong>DON&rsquo;T</strong>:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Add a new main navigation tab for every single page you add to the site. Websites that are poorly organized or have 25 main navigation tabs are hard to navigate.</li>
            <li>Use academic jargon. Web content should be in simple English.</li>
            <li>Put text on images, as screen readers won&rsquo;t pick it up causing visually impaired users to miss out on the content. If it is necessary to use a complex image to convey information, contact Marketing &amp; Communications to see if there are ways to make it accessible.</li>
            <li>Add all new info at the top of the page. Think about where any new information fits into the site as a whole.</li>
            <li>Use larger or different color text for emphasis. For example, don&rsquo;t use red text or underlined text for emphasis.</li>
            <li>Swap out photos. Contact Dave Brogan and/or Anna Burleson and we&rsquo;ll get it done quickly!</li>

            <h4>Naming files, pages and sites</h4>

            <p>File names, folder names and web addresses should be styled consistently across weber.edu.<br />
              This is based on research-based direct recommendations from Google.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Separate words in the Site Manager &ldquo;Name&rdquo; field with hyphens. This becomes the name of the web page file.
                <ul>
                  <li>Ex: /marketing-and-communications.html</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Separate words in uploaded file names (images, documents, etc) also with hyphens.

              <li>Separate words in the &ldquo;Title&rdquo; field with spaces. This becomes the title users see in the browser tab.</li>
              <li>Make your title, page and file names as descriptive as possible. Spell it out with hyphens.
                <ul>
                  <li>Ex: /college-of-advanced-marketing.html</li>

              </li>
              <li>NOT: /coam.html</li>
              <li>Make &ldquo;Name&rdquo; and &ldquo;Title&rdquo; fields in the Site Manager dashboard and &ldquo;Page Title&rdquo; in the page template all match, if not exactly, then as close as possible. The page title entered in the template is displayed at the top of the page.</li>
